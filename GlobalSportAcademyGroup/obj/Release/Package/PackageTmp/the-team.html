                                        Rob has  also been given the opportunity to work on grass roots programs such as “Hockey Calgary Magazine” a weekly resource for coaches, parents, and players that has been on the air since 2008. During the 2009/2010 season we did a companion program called “Hockey Canada Frequency” which we worked with the sport’s national governing body on a one hour magazine show. A background in Public Relations and marketing with both the SAIT Trojans and Estevan Bruins has allowed Rob to pursue his passions in the sports and entertainment industry. Rob is also a former goaltender and runs a not for profit hockey school for less fortunate kids in the summer.
